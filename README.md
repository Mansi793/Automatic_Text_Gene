# Automatic_Text_Gene

This project aims to generate text using TensorFlow and a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Below are the steps involved in proceeding with this project:

1. **Introduction to the Project**:
   - The project involves training a machine learning model to generate text based on a given input.
   - TensorFlow and LSTM are the primary tools utilized for this task.

2. **Explanation of Text Generation**:
   - Text generation involves training a model on a large corpus of text data and then predicting the next word or token in a sequence.
   - The goal is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the patterns learned from the training data.

3. **Installation and Setup**:
   - Before diving into the code execution, it's essential to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.
   - Detailed instructions on installing TensorFlow and any other required libraries should be provided.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data preprocessing is crucial for cleaning and preparing the text data for model training.
   - This step involves tasks such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and handling special characters.

5. **Tokenization and Sequence Generation**:
   - Tokenization involves breaking down the text into smaller units (tokens) for further processing.
   - Sequences of fixed length are generated from the tokenized text to serve as input and output data for the model.

6. **Model Building**:
   - Building the model architecture involves defining the layers and structure of the neural network.
   - In this project, TensorFlow is used to create an LSTM-based model for text generation.


7. **Model Building**:
   - After preprocessing the data, the next step is to build the model architecture.
   - The model begins with a sequential model, and the first layer is an embedding layer.
   - The embedding layer represents each token with a vector of the full vocabulary size.
   - A sequence length parameter determines how many input values are considered before predicting the output.
   - Additional layers, such as LSTM layers, are added to the model to capture sequential dependencies.

8. **Model Summary**:
   - A summary of the model architecture is provided, showing the number of parameters and layers.
   - Note that the model has around 2.1 million parameters, which may require significant computational resources to train.

9. **Model Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
   - Categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function for multiclass classification.
   - The accuracy metric is chosen to evaluate the model's performance during training.

10. **Model Training**:
    - The model is trained using a specified number of epochs and batch size.
    - In this case, the model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 256.
    - After training, the accuracy of the model is evaluated, which is approximately 34.0%.

11. **Model Testing**:
    - To test the trained model, a random line from the original dataset is selected.
    - This line is used as input to a prediction function to generate text based on the model's predictions.
    - The generated text demonstrates the model's ability to produce coherent and grammatically correct output.

12. **Conclusion**:
    - The README concludes with a summary of the text generation process using LSTM recurrent neural networks.
    - It emphasizes the model's ability to generate text resembling English and the importance of proper model evaluation and testing.
